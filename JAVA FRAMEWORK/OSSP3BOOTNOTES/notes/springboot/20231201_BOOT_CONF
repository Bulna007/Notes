What are the various different sources from where the SpringApplication class would detect and loads the external configuration of our application into the environment object?
1. if we enable devtools module in our project then it looks for spring-boot-devtools.properties file under $USER_HOME directory and loads into the environment object
2. it looks for an environment variable with name "SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON" populated with json object as value. it parses the objects key/value pair and loads into the environment object
3. if WebApplicationType is WEB then loads init-params and context-params into the env object
4. all the env variables 
5. all the java system properties
6. RandomeValueSourceProperty that we specified in application.properties
7. the application.properties|yaml file under any of these locations
	7.1 under project root
	7.2 under project/config directory
	7.3 under classpath
	7.4 under classpath/config directory
