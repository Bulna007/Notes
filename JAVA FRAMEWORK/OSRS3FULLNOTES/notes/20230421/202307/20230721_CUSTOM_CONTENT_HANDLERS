By using the supported parameterTypes and returnTypes defined by the jaxrs runtime, we can receive the data from request body or dispatch the data aspart of response body within the resource class and its methods. But this way of dealing with request/response body works in raw representation formats which means
our resource class/methods are directly receiving and dispatching the data in the format that is being exchanged (json/xml/yaml etc) due to which we run into several problems
1. The business logic that we write aspart of the resource class/methods will be exposed to the raw representation format of the data due to which
	1.1 a change the data representation like switching from json to yaml or xml will effect the business logic, since our business logic is directly reading the data from that raw format
	1.2 if there is a change structure/semantics of the raw data, again the business logic will be impacted
	1.3 the business logic will be tightly coupled with data extraction apis we are using in reading/extracting or writing the data, if we are switching to an different data management apis, again there will be an impact on business logic
	1.4 we cannot apply the same business logic around multiple data representation formats, we need to duplicate the business logic to work with multiple formats of data
	
To overcome this problem we need to always build our business logic around objects of data only, so that our business logic can work agnostic to data representation format
