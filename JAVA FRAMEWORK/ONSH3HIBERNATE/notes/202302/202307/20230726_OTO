one-to-many / many-to-one association
There are 3 types of collections are supported by hibernate in representing an one-to-many association between entity classes.
1. Set   = Set is an unordered collection of unique objects  
2. List  = Indexed based collection of objects, here insertion order is preserved while retrieving the data. Duplicate objects are allowed
3. Map   = key/value pair based collection

How do we map an List one-to-may association into the database model?
List is an indexed based collection, that can be used for preserving the insertion order of the objects
