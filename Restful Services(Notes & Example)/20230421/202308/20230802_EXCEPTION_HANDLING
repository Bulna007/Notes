Exception Handling
When the resource class methods are reporting/throwing an exception, the jaxrs runtime receives the exception and reports it as error response to the client

The default behaviour of jaxrs runtime in propagating the exceptions to the client:
By default jaxrs runtime upon receiving the exception, it constructs an http response message with
1. status code: 500 (internal server error)
2. headers = standard response headers
3. response body = stacktrace of the exception
and dispatches it to the client

appropriate status code with response body contains error information that is parsable, interpretable and understandable for the clients to process

HTTP RESPONSE
status: 400 (BAD REQUEST)
header
standard headers
body
{
	"errorcode": "a001",
	"errorcause": "subscription not active"
}
