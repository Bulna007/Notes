@Autowired
-----------
@Autowired annotation is used for managing the dependencies between the bean definitions. In case of @Autowired annotation there is no mode of autowiring, always the dependent bean definition object is identified by matching with Type only

@Autowired annotation can be written at #4 different places within an class
1. ATTRIBUTE LEVEL
2. CONSTRUCTOR LEVEL
3. SETTER LEVEL
4. ARBITARY METHOD LEVEL

mode of autowiring indicates:
1. how to identify the dependent bean object
2. how to inject

1. Incase of @Autowired annotation, always the dependent bean is identified byType only
2. injects based on the place where we have written the annotation on

class Radio {
	private TransReceiver transReceiver;
	

	public void listen() {
		transReciever.on();
		sop("listening...");
	}

}

class TransReceiver {
	private String signalType;
	private int frequency;
	
	public void on() {}
	// setter
}

application-context.xml
-----------------------
<bean id="radio" class="Radio"/>

<bean id="transReceiver" class="TransReceiver">
	<property name="signalType" value="analog"/>
	<property name="frequency" value="108"/>
</bean>


Test.java
---------
ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("application-context.xml");
Radio radio = context.getBean("radio", Radio.class);
