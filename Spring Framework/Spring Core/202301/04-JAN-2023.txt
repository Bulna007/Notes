Spring is a very big framework, despite of being huge still it is considered as light weight application development framework. Let us try to understand how spring framework is being called as light weight application development framework

Spring Framework has not been distributed as an single piece, rather it has been broken down into several modules
1. core
2. aop
3. jdbc
4. tx
5. orm
6. oxm
7. datajpa
8. security
9. web
10. aspects
11. instrumentation
12. beans
13. context
14. context-support
15. spring boot
16. spring cloud
17. spring microservices
18. spring webflux
etc

when we look at the architecture of the Spring Framework the fundamental or the base module that spans across the breath of the Framework is Spring Core
The Spring Framework developers while dividing the Framework into modules, ensured that no 2 modules has overlap or inter-dependency with each other, where all the modules are dependent on the core module only.

Now the developer based on the type of the application he wish to develop can choose the modules relevant for his project
1. learn only those specific areas of spring framework 
2. use those modules in building the application
thus making the spring framework light weight. From this we can understand we dont need to care how big the Framework is we only need to care of what we wanted out of it for usage
