How many bean scopes are there?
There are 4 bean scopes are there
1. singleton
2. prototype
3. request
4. session

1. singleton = only one object of the bean definition should be created within the scope of the ioc container and should return the same object, whenever requested.
	
2. prototype = each time we request for the object for the bean definition from the ioc container, the ioc container should return a new instance of the bean definition.
	
singleton design pattern
------------------------
For any given class, if we can create only one single object within the scope of the application, then that class is called "singleton" class
How to make a class as Singleton class?
by default every class in java is not singleton, when we create a class, jvm allows us to create any number of objects for that class, so every class is not singleton bydefault.
Then how to make a class as Singleton?

class DateUtils {
	private static DateUtils instance;
	
	private DateUtils() {} // dont let the other classes instantiate the object by declaring the constructor of the class as private
	
	public static DateUtils getInstance() { // let the other class create the object of your class by exposing an static factory
		if(instance == null) {                    // method
			instance = new DateUtils();	
		}		
		return instance;
	}
