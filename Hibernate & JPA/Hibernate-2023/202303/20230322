How to establish relationship between the tables in relational database management system?
In RDBMS we establish relationship between the data/records across the tables by using primary key and foreign keys. A primarykey acts as an logical address of the record through which we establish relationship with other records of another table by writing it as an foreign key in another table	

There are 3 types of relationships we can establish between the tables
1. one-to-one
2. one-to-many / many-to-one
3. many-to-many


1. one-to-many
Two tables are said to be in one-to-many relationship means a record in my table is in relationship with multiple records in another table.
one project can have many associates working in it. the otherside of the relationship always has one-to-one which means one member works in one project only
