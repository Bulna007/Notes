problems in storing semi-structured data in relational tables:
1. complexity in designing the schema model for storing the data is very high
2. programmers has to write complex logic in performing the persistence operations on these tables
3. while storing the semi-structured data in relational tables as columnar tables, we endup in breaking down the data across the tables, so that we would need to perform unnecessary joins in fetching the data from the tables
4. the cost of retrieval of the data is very high, because we need filter the data from joins

mongodb/couchdb = documents
cassendra, dynamodb = key/value pair in columnar fashion
