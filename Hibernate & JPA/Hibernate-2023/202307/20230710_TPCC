Table per concreate class:
how the tables are created for the inherited hierarchy of classes?
For each concrete class in the hierarchy one seperate table will be created
	
How does the database operations will be performed on the underlying entity classes?
1. PERSIST/SAVE:
	1. superclass:
	directly into the superclass table
	2. subclass:
	directly into the subclass table

To support polymorphic retrieval of the data across the entity classes in the hierarchy the id/pk column should be unique. 
To ensure the pk column is unique we should not use identity generator.
We can use 
1.1 increment (hibernate only): it uses an union query to find the max(id) from all the tables
1.2 sequence generator = we need to use same sequence name in generating the id for all the tables in the hierarchy
1.3 Table generator = the pk columnname to be used for generating the id should be same across all the tables/entities in the hierarchy

2. GET/FETCH:
	1. subclass: directly query the data from the subclass table
	2. superclass: query the data from all the tables in hierarchy using union query and identify the record belongs to which table and return an appropriate entity class object.
