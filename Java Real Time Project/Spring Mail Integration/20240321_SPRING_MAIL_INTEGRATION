Java Mail Api
-------------
Aspart of every application handling mails is an typical requirement. The software application should be able to construct/send emails programmatically to the users of the application in many scenarios. For eg.. in an e-commerce application we want the system to generate/send emails to the customers when
1. a new user has been registered into the system for email verification
2. incase of forgot password, we need to send an email asking the user to reset
3. when a user has placed an order
etc

when a action/event happened in the application, the system should be able to notify the users by sending emails. Handling these email deliveries manually is very difficult/errorneous instead we want the software program itself to generate these emails and send them programmatically, that is where java mail api has been introduced.
	
Inorder to understand how to use java mail api in sending/receiving the emails, first we need to have knowledge on how does emails works?
