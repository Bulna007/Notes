How to use bootstrap aspart of webpages?
Always we need to use HTML5 page templates only while using bootstrap because HTML5 has provided meta tags and media queries in rendering the web pages based on the layout or viewport of the page

We need to import css in the head section only and javascript at the end of the body or before closing the HTML tag. The order in which we need to include these javascript libraries are:
1. popper.js
2. jquery
3. bootstrap.min.js
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bootstrap Grid System
Bootstrap Grid System is used for building responsive page layouts of a webpage and it is pre-dominantly used in the market for building webpages

Bootstrap grid system has provided pre-defined css classes through which we can breakdown the entire webpage into rows and columns and can organize/place elements into these rows and columns in tabular fashion without using HTML Tables.

Grid css classes
-----------------
The bootstrap grid has provided six css classes:
1. xs = (for mobile phones - screen size <576px)
2. sm = (for tablets - ≥576px)	
3. md = (for laptops screens = ≥768px)	
4. lg = (for laptops of big screens = ≥992px)	
5. xl = (for desktop screens ≥1200px)
6. xxl = (larger screens of ≥1400px)
	
depends on the screen resolution the columns on the page would be arranged automatically while using the grid layout. To start with using the grid layout we need to do the below:

1. define a root div and apply the css class as "container" or "container-fluid" (it occupies the entire screen width). Then place the rows inside the container
2. use rows to create horizontal group of columns with css as "row". Write a div tag inside the container with css class as "row"
3. we can place contents only within the columns.	columns are the immediate children of the rows. To create columns in each row we need to define a div tag inside the row with css as ".col-xs-span" or "col-sm-span" or "col-md-span" or "col-lg-span"
	
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-4">
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-4">
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-4">
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6">
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-12">
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
